miniki
======

A minimalist wiki.

Why another wiki?
-----------------

The aim of miniki is to provide the core features of a wiki in a very intuitive way.

Mind meld
---------

Wiki page hierarchies can often get out of control, so one feature of miniki is to provide a mind-map layout of
page hierarchies in order to provide a better overview and allow re-structuring in a way that makes sense
